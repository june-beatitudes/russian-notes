# Goals

In general, my primary goals for learning Russian are as follows:

* Be able to converse fluidly and with minimal gaps when talking about common topics as well as topics of personal interest
* Be able to pick up terminology naturally and learn to converse about more complex topics that are not of personal interest
* Be able to read and write at a high (~college) level with minimal grammatical and vocabulary errors
* Have pronunciation that is, while not indistinguishable from a native speaker, difficult to place as a distinctly non-native accent (for example, aspects of a mix of dialects is probably fine)

This most directly corresponds to a CEFR level of **B2/C1**. Ideally, at some point, this could be confirmed with a TORFL; however, for various political reasons, this is not currently feasible.
