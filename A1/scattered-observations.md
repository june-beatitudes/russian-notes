# Scattered Observations
1. Use с + prepositional when it's alongside, use используя + accusative when it's using/with the use of
2. Use своё to mean "X's own", it's a little stronger / places more emphasis
3. Time adverbs usually go directly before the verb (sounds more natural), though they can go at the beginning of the sentence if extra emphasis is necessary
4. Сопроводить is a very formal way to say "accompany", in an informal context say "[verb] с(о) [instrumental]" (for example, "Пойду на Panda Express, хочешь пойти со мной?")
