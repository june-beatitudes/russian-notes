# Future Tense

The Russian future tense is simple to form. For imperfective verbs, one simply takes the infinitive (or infinitive with reflexive) and precedes it with a present-tense conjugation of быть:

| | First-Person | Second-Person | Third-Person |
|- |- |- |- |
| Singular | | |
| Plural | | | |
