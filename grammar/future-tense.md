# Future Tense

The Russian future tense is simple to form. For imperfective verbs, one simply takes the infinitive (or infinitive with reflexive) and precedes it with a present-tense conjugation of быть:

| | First-Person | Second-Person | Third-Person |
|- |- |- |- |
| Singular | буду | будешь | будет |
| Plural | будем | будете | будут |

For perfective verbs, one simply conjugated it as if it were present tense.
